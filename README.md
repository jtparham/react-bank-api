### Objective

I have built a mock bank that utilizes typescript on the backend and React on the front end.

### Brief

While modern banks have evolved to serve a plethora of functions, at their core, banks must provide certain basic features. This project is to showcase a basic API with a simple front end interface.

### Tasks

- There should be API routes that allows users to:
  - Create a new bank account for a customer, with an initial deposit amount. A
    single customer may have multiple bank accounts.
  - Transfer amounts between any two accounts, including those owned by
    different customers.
  - Retrieve balances for a given account.
  - Retrieve transfer history for a given account.
- Write tests for your business logic
